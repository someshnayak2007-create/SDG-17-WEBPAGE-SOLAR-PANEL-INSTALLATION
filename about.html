        <h1>About Solar Energy</h1>

        <p>
            Solar energy is one of the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy sources available today.
            It converts sunlight into electricity without causing pollution or harming the environment.
            By using solar power, homes and businesses can reduce their electricity bills, support
            sustainability, and contribute to a cleaner future for the planet.

            <h2 style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: lora;">SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.6;">
                SDG 7 focuses on "Affordable and Clean Energy". It aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable,
                sustainable, and modern energy for all. This includes improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of
                renewable energy sources, and expanding access to energy, especially in regions that are currently
                underserved or lacking electricity infrastructure. <br>

                The specific targets under SDG 7 include: <br>

                Universal access to energy: Ensuring everyone has access to affordable and reliable modern energy
                services. <br>

                Increasing renewable energy: Substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy
                <br>
                mix.

                Energy efficiency: Doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. <br>

                International cooperation: Promoting research and development of clean and renewable energy
                technologies, especially in developing countries. <br>

                <b style="font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 15px; font-family: lora;">Why SDG-7 Matters</b> <br>
                <u><b>SDG 7 is critical for several reasons:</b></u> <br><br>

                Economic Development: Energy is a key driver of economic growth. Without reliable energy, industries,
                businesses, and communities cannot thrive. Access to affordable energy promotes job creation, poverty
                reduction, and overall development. <br><br>

                Poverty Reduction: More than 700 million people around the world still lack access to electricity.
                Without electricity, people are forced to rely on inefficient and often dangerous energy sources like
                kerosene or wood. This limits their ability to improve their lives. <br><br>

                Health and Well-being: Clean energy improves health outcomes by reducing air pollution. For example,
                transitioning away from biomass burning (like cooking with wood or charcoal) reduces respiratory
                diseases, particularly in women and children who are most exposed to indoor air pollution. <br><br>

                Environmental Impact: SDG 7 is closely linked to combating climate change. Renewable energy sources,
                like wind, solar, and hydropower, are key to reducing carbon emissions. The shift from fossil fuels to
                cleaner energy is essential for meeting global climate targets and reducing the impacts of climate
                change. <br><br>

                Sustainability: Energy is at the heart of many other SDGs. Access to clean energy supports education,
                gender equality, clean water, and other sustainable development goals. It's also essential for food
                security, transportation, and building resilient infrastructure. <br><br>

                Solar energy directly supports SDG 7 by providing clean and renewable power, reducing carbon
                emissions, and making electricity more accessible to remote and developing regions. Adopting
                solar solutions helps the world move toward a greener and more sustainable future. <br><br>
